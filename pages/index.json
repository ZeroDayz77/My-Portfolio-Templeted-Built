        "description": "This mobile app MVP was not only initially created in 2 weeks to challenge myself but to also act as a way to show my skill in learning new technologies and adapting to the task given to me. This was a good learning experience and reinforced the reason to me as to why we do computer science and technology as a hold, to solve real-world problems. The problem for me was, I no longer had a music app. There were many issues, unused features and ideas.",
